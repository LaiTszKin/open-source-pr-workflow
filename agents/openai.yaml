  short_description: "Prepare and open high-quality OSS PRs"
  default_prompt: "Prepare a pull request for an open-source repository from existing changes, ensure branch names follow codex/{change_type}/{changes}, default forked repositories to open PRs against the upstream parent repository unless the user explicitly asks for the fork, and open/update a PR with related issues or motivation, engineering decisions with rationale, and test results with commands. If code changes are involved, run edge-case-test-fixer first and code-simplifier second before opening the PR. Keep PR content strictly about the PR itself and do not include internal skill or tool process notes. Do not implement new features in this workflow."

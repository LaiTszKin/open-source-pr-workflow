  default_prompt: "Prepare a pull request for an open-source repository from existing changes, ensure branch names follow codex/feature/{feature_name}, default forked repositories to open PRs against the upstream parent repository unless the user explicitly asks for the fork, and open/update a PR with related issues or motivation, engineering decisions with rationale, and test results with commands. Do not implement new features in this workflow."
